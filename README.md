# Course Wrangler Deletion Block

This plugin depends on hugoacfs/tool_coursewrangler, and is part of the Course Wrangler project.

The purpose of this plugin is to automatically display a block on courses. This block offers information to users based on their role: users who are of a certain role (usually roles with editing rights, it is based on archtype) can see the block. Site administrators can also see the block, including a link to the Course Wrangle Report page for the course.

## Settings

You can change who sees the block based on what is the status of the course page:

- If you want the block to show on courses which are not present in course wrangler data: Tick "Show in All Courses" setting.
- If you don't want the block to show on protected courses: Tick "Do Not Show 'Protect'" setting.
- If you don't want the block to show on courses to delete: Tick "Do Not Show 'Delete'" setting.
- If you don't want admins to see the manage option on the block: Untick "Admins see 'Manage'" setting.
